It is Assignment 2 of Computer Vision course, NYU. The assignment is a Kaggle class competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyu-cv-fall-2018

My models achieved a test accuracy of 0.98970 on the public test dataset and 0.98891 on the private test dataset. I implemented Shallow ConvNet with Concatenation, Deep ConvNet with BatchNorm, ConvNet with Inception Modules and ResNet, all of which were trained from scratch.

This is my first touch with a vision project via PyTorch.
